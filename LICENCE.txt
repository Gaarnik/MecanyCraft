This document describes the terms under which MecanyCraft, from
now on also refered to as the "Mod" or the "Software" may be used.



1 - USAGE

This Software is open-source. You can use it's source code in other
software projects you are involved in. You can, in the same way,
use it's resources (images, sound, etc) in other software projects.
Take note however, that some resources are derived from Minecraft's
resources and are property of Mojang AB, which binds the usage of
said resources to Mojang AB's terms.

The permission to use this software's source code or resources in
any other software project only applies if the project using this
software's source code or resources is free software. This permission
is revoked from any commercial software.

In the spirit of open-source, you are welcome to commit enhancements
to our github repository, but we have the final say in which pull
requests we accept and which ones we don't. You can also modify this
Mod for personal use, as long as you keep those modifications for
yourself. Publishing said modifications violates this license.
You can, however, create a Minecraft Mod that interfaces with the Mod
this license refers to, as long as it doesn't override any part of it.

This mod can be used in any public or private compilation of mods (also 
known as "Mod Pack") without any permission from the developer.



2 - WARRANTY & LIABILITY

Use this software at your own risk.

The software developer takes no liability for any damage that may occur to
your software, hardware or yourself.

This software comes with no warranties, express or implied.
